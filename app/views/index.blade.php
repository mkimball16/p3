<h1>Welcome to the Generator Genie: A Developer's Best Friend</h1>
<img class="genie" src='/images/genie.png' alt='genie'>
<p class="intro">Do you ever need random users or text to help populate a website during testing phases? 
Do you ever wish generating this information could happen in the blink of an eye, or perhaps a rub of
a magic lantern? Well, your wish is my comand. The links above will take you to separate pages where 
you can wish for a specific number of random users or paragraphs of lorem ipsum text you would 
like to receive. Just click a link, indicate the desired number by adding /[number] in the URL bar, 
and you wish will be granted!</p>
