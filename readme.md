## Description of the project: 
I created a "Generator Genie: A Developer's Best Friend", which allows the user to generate a specific
number of random users or paragraphs of lorem ipsum text based on preferences they can set. 

## Demo information: 
I will be demoing Generator Genie in Jeremy's 7:30-9pm virtual class on Wednesday, October 29.

## Additional info:
I used two packages: badcow/lorem-ipsum and fzaninotto/faker. I also applied a genie theme, because I feel like these were "Ask and you shall receive" type of tools. Wanted to have a little fun with it. Attempted to apply controllers, but I don't think I am quite there yet. Will definitely be exploring those in prep for P4.
